This Java-based AI Chatbot engages users in friendly conversation and offers interactive games, including Rock, Paper, Scissors, Number Guessing, and Trivia. Designed to simulate a human-like interaction, the chatbot remembers user preferences, provides personalized responses, and tracks scores across games. With a focus on basic natural language processing (NLP) and user engagement, this project demonstrates core chatbot functionalities within Java.

The AI Chatbot is a simple yet interactive Java application that:

Responds to user greetings, preferences, and keywords to simulate human interaction.
Offers multiple games with replay options, including Rock, Paper, Scissors, Number Guessing, and Trivia.
Tracks and displays user scores, streaks, and personalized responses based on score and preferences.
Adds simulated typing pauses and "thinking" messages to create a more natural conversation flow.
Skills Used
Java Programming: Core Java concepts like classes, methods, loops, conditionals, and collections (e.g., ArrayList and HashMap) form the structure of the chatbot.
Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used simple keyword matching to interpret user input and respond appropriately.
User Interaction and Memory: The chatbot can store and recall user preferences, such as their name, and uses personalized messages based on score and preferences.
Game Logic Implementation: Developed logic for games with scoring, streaks, and replay options.
Simulated Typing and Delays: Added pauses to simulate typing and "thinking" messages, enhancing the human-like interaction.
Development Process
Setting Up the Chatbot Structure: Defined the basic chatbot class, created methods for processing input, and set up a loop for continuous interaction.

Implementing Basic Conversation and Memory: Added functionality for greeting responses, user name recognition, and personalized messages using simple NLP techniques (keyword detection).

Adding Games: Developed individual methods for each game:

Rock, Paper, Scissors: Used conditional logic to compare choices and track user wins.
Number Guessing: Generated a random number and used loops for repeated guessing.
Trivia: Created a bank of questions and answers, allowing users to respond and receive feedback on correctness.
Incorporating Replay and Score Tracking: Enabled replay options after each game and tracked user scores and streaks.

Enhancing User Experience: Added simulated typing delays and random "thinking" messages to mimic human interaction and make the chatbot feel more engaging.

Features
Multiple Games: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Number Guessing, and Trivia with built-in replay options.
Personalization: The bot remembers the userâ€™s name and provides personalized responses based on their preferences and score.
Typing Simulation: Adds a short pause and "thinking" messages to simulate typing for a more natural feel.
Score and Streak Tracking: Keeps track of the user's score and win streak across games, with encouraging responses based on performance.
